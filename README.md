# user-mode-diagnostics-application-for-accessing-Altera-PCI-Express-cards-with-Avalon-MM-support-
The source code for this project is provided with Jungo WinDriver. To compile this application, you will need a compiler and CMake installed.

**WinDriver Altera Avalon MM Sample**
The source code for this project is provided with Jungo WinDriver. To compile this application, you will need a compiler and CMake installed.
**Files**
**avalonmm_diag.c** - The main file which demonstrates access to the Altera Avalon MM IP, using AVALONMM_lib.c
**avalonmm_lib.c** -  A library for accessing the Altera Avalon MM IP using the WinDriver High Level APIs
**CMakeLists.txt** - An input file for the CMake build system.
**readme.pdf** - Describes the sample files.

We provide several methods for compiling this code:
**Compiling this project using Microsoft Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code**
If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or higher, or Visual Studio Code, make sure to have CMake support installed for it.
When you open the sample folder (with File->Open->Folder...) or open the CMakeLists.txt file (with File->Open->CMake...), Visual
Studio will automatically invoke the cmake command to generate a CMake cache for the project. To generate cache manually, press the
'Switch between solutions and available views' button, right click on the CMake project and select 'Generate Cache'.
Expand the CMake project - all available targets for the project will be listed.
Right clicking on the target will allow you to build it.

**Compiling using a different IDE/Compiler:**
Run the following command in the terminal from the working directory of the project:
$ cmake . -B build
This will create a Unix Makefile for the project in a new sub-directory named build. To build it, go to that sub-directory and run:
$ make
To add verbosity to a build you can run:
$ VERBOSE=1 make
or if you prefer the build to always be verbose you can generate the CMake cache in the following way:
$ cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
You can use CMake to generate projects for various other platforms and IDEs. Consult CMake's documentation for more information.

**Creating your own project**
Create a new project using your IDE.
Choose console mode project.
Include the following files in the project: avalonmm_diag.c
avalonmm_lib.c
Include the WinDriver Diagnostics samples shared files: (WD_BASEDIR)/samples/c/shared/wdc_diag_lib.c
(WD_BASEDIR)/samples/c/diag_lib.c $(WD_BASEDIR) is the directory where WinDriver is installed at.
Link your project with $(WD_BASEDIR)/lib/wdapi<version>.lib (Windows) or $(WD_BASEDIR)/lib/libwdapi<version>.so
(Linux) or $(WD_BASEDIR)/lib/libwdapi<version>.dylib (MacOS) In order to access WinDriver's High-Level API.
$(WD_BASEDIR) is the directory where WinDriver is installed at.
Make sure to add the relevant flags to your system: -DKERNEL_64BIT if using a 64-bit operating system. -DWD_DRIVER_NAME_CHANGE if
using a renamed driver.

**Converting to a GUI application:**
This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than a GUI application) that uses standard input and output. This was done in order
to simplify the source code. You may change it into a GUI application by removing all calls to printf() and scanf() functions, and calling
MessageBox() instead (on Windows). On other operating systems, you can use the relevant libraries such as GTK or Qt.
